	  <h2>Some info</h2>
	  <p>This website exists mostly for documenting my experiments in the topic of software development. For software I develop, this website will serve as a place to log changes, and document future plans.</p>
	  <p>I would be inaccurate, however, if I did only mention that this is the sole purpose of this website. It involves software since Github is hosting this, and I learned of Github before I did about Github Pages. But, for example, I also intend on write some material over school and learning topics, and maybe even rant or reflect about specific ideas. More can probably be found in the README somewhere in this page.
	  <p>In terms of software development, I mostly prefer things at a lower level. Developing websites does not seem as interesting as developing software for microcontrolers, as an example. The hardware I own is not that niche, and I'm not yet sure if whatever I'll be doing will involve it.
